## About MailMate
MailMate is a niche, highly advanced email client built specifically for power users, developers, researchers, and anyone who values efficiency and control above all else. It embraces a philosophy where the keyboard is the primary interface, allowing you to fly through your inbox, apply complex filters, and compose responses without ever touching the mouse. This focus on keyboard navigation, combined with deep support for Markdown and LaTeX, makes it uniquely suited for technical communication, academic collaboration, and users who manage high volumes of email with precision.

The application is not designed to be the simplest email client, but rather the most powerful and customizable one. It offers deep and correct IMAP support, advanced searching with regular expressions, and a unique "message viewer" system that lets you display emails exactly how you want. Its integration capabilities are exceptional, allowing you to pipe email content to external scripts or trigger actions based on rules. For users tired of the limitations and simplistic designs of mainstream email apps, MailMate provides a robust, no-compromise environment where you are in complete command of your email workflow.
